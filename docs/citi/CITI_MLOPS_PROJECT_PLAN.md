# Citi MLOps: Dataset Orchestration and Finetune Platform

**Document type:** Project plan and architecture (living document)  
**Status:** Draft  
**Related fork:** Citi MLOps Plane — recipes, experiments, GSSP-GS and Stellar orchestration; no local model execution.

---

## Executive summary

This project delivers an **orchestrated, API-first** product for: **(1)** multiformat **data ingestion** (upload, S3, blob), **(2)** **data preparation and dataset creation** in our control plane (chunking, cleaning, row generation, **train/test/val split**), **(3)** **LLM-assisted** steps via **GSSP GS** (treated as an **OpenAI-compatible LLM API** for calls only), **(4)** **Stellar** to **register and store** data produced by the pipeline (Stellar does **not** create datasets; **we** build datasets first, then **register/store** artifacts in Stellar as required), **(5)** **finetune and evaluation** via the appropriate Citi services (endpoints and ownership per integration contract; Stellar is **not** the dataset-creation system), and **(6)** a **Model Garden / marketplace** UI so users can **select, preconfigure, and inspect** where **base and finetuned** models live—**without** this platform **hosting** model weights or running training compute locally.

---

## A. Problem statement, scope, and corrected assumptions

### A.1 In scope

- **Orchestration** (BFF, workflows, state, retries, audit context).
- **Ingestion** from **direct upload** and **object storage** (S3, Azure Blob, and equivalents per Citi standards).
- **Data preparation** owned by this product: **chunking**, **normalization**, **row construction**, **validation**, **optional retrieval-only vectorization** when a recipe **explicitly** needs RAG-style preparation (not the default for every recipe).
- **GSSP GS** for **LLM calls only** (OpenAI-API–style: chat/completions; prompts, tools if supported). All **other** preparation logic—scheduling, chunk boundaries, schema assembly, **splitting**—lives in **orchestration** and/or Citi data services **outside** GSSP.
- **Stellar:** **Registering and storing** data only (per Citi Stellar contract). Stellar is **not** used to **create** or **define** training datasets. **We** build datasets in **our** pipeline (rows, files, manifest); **then** we **register** and **store** the resulting artifacts in Stellar for downstream use. **Finetune** and **run status** for training jobs: follow the **Citi service map** (Stellar, another gateway, or both—separate from “dataset creation”). **We** own **train / test / val split** in orchestration, **before** or **as** we prepare what gets registered in Stellar.
- **Evaluation** via internal Evaluation API; surface results in **metrics and dashboards**.
- **Auth context** propagated on every call: **Correlation ID**, **SOEID**, **Client ID**, **Coin JWT** (or successor), for **approvals and audit**.

### A.2 Out of scope (for core product line)

- **Hosting** model weights, serving **inference** at scale, or **local GPU training** for this line.
- Treating GSSP as a **full data-prep** or **ETL** engine: it is **not**; it is **LLM API only**.

### A.3 GSSP GS (correction)

- **GSSP GS** = **LLM API surface** (analogous to **OpenAI API**): used for **generation, transformation, classification labels, JSON filling**, etc., given **our** prepared **prompts and inputs**.
- **We** own: **ingestion**, **chunking**, **cleaning**, **dataset creation** (all row assembly), **orchestrated** multi-step **pipelines**, **row schemas**, **splits**, **quarantine**, and **export formatting** that is then **registered/stored in Stellar** (Stellar does not create the dataset). GSSP is invoked **where** a step needs an LLM; it does **not** replace a data platform.

### A.4 Stellar: register / store only; not dataset creation (correction)

- **Stellar** is for **registering and storing** data (handles, objects, or metadata the API defines). It does **not** create or build training datasets.
- **Dataset creation** (examples, JSONL, tables, **splits**, validation) is **entirely** in **orchestration** and connected services; outputs are then **registered/stored in Stellar** as needed for lineage and handoff.
- **Train / test / (val) split** is **always** **our** responsibility in the **preparation** pipeline, **before** or **as** we produce artifacts that are **registered** in Stellar—Stellar does **not** perform splitting or row generation.
- **Typical order:** **(1)** ingest and prepare in our system, **(2)** build and split the dataset, **(3)** **register/store** the resulting artifact(s) in Stellar, **(4)** invoke **finetune** and **eval** per the **Citi APIs** (which may or may not be the same system as the Stellar register/store path—see integration contract).

### A.5 Model garden / marketplace (correction, no hosting)

- We **do not** host models in the platform.
- We **must** still provide a **Model Garden (marketplace) experience** in the **UI**:
  - **Discover** and **list** **base** and **finetuned** models from **all integrated model registries and catalogs** (internal catalogs, Hugging Face where allowed, Citi model stores, etc.); **Stellar** is **not** assumed to be a model registry—use the **Citi model** integration map (Stellar may only handle **data** register/store).
  - **Select** a **base** or **finetuned** model for **preconfiguration** of a finetune job (where policy allows).
  - **View metadata**: **where** the model **lives** (registry, URI, ID), **lineage** (e.g. parent base), **version**, **compliance** tags.
  - **Button-driven** flows: "Choose model", "View in registry" (link-out), "Use in pipeline."
- The **BFF** aggregates **read-only** (and where permitted, **action**) calls to **registry APIs**; **no weights** through this app.

### A.6 Modalities and recipe families

- **Multiformat text** (PDF, DOC, etc.), **image** (as input to prepared text or multimodal rows per policy).
- **Recipes** include: Q&A, summarization, sentiment, classification, structured extraction, completion, **conversational / multi-turn**, **multi-model / multi-turn** conversation construction (orchestrated **calls** to GSSP with different **model_id**s per turn where supported).
- **Ingestion** from **S3** and **blob** in addition to upload.

### A.7 Local compute and "no model ops"

- **No** colocated finetune **compute** in-app.
- **Yes** to **Model Garden UI** and **job configuration** that **point** to **external** training and models (Citi finetune/training service per contract, not conflated with Stellar’s register/store role).
- **Vectorization** only when a recipe **requires retrieval** in the preparation path; not required for all finetune datasets.

---

## B. Phased plan of action (implementation)

### B.1 Phase 0 — Decisions and guardrails

- ADRs: BFF language, Stellar + GSSP + Ingestion **contracts** (OpenAPI or internal specs).
- **PII, retention, regions**, and **which** registries are allowed for **Model Garden**.

### B.2 Phase 1 — Identity and request context

- Middleware: validate **Coin JWT** (or delegate to Citi IdP), bind **SOEID**, **Client ID**, **Correlation ID** to **Run** and **outbound** HTTP.
- **Structured logging** and **trace** propagation.

### B.3 Phase 2 — Ingestion

- **Upload** and **S3 / blob** connectors; **Ingestion service** for **chunking** and **provenance**; return **document_id**, **chunks** (or job handles).

### B.4 Phase 3 — Data preparation (platform-owned, GSSP as LLM only)

- **Recipe engine**: steps for cleaning, **row generation** (calls **GSSP** with our prompts/inputs), validation.
- **Split:** **in our** pipeline after (or as part of) **dataset** materialization and **before** (or as part of packaging for) **register/store in Stellar**; persist split boundaries, manifests, and references used by finetune and eval APIs.

### B.5 Phase 4 — Stellar and downstream training handoff

- **Stellar:** **Register and store** prepared artifacts per contract (**no** dataset creation on Stellar).
- **Finetune** (or equivalent) job submission to the **Citi training/finetune** API per **service map** (not assumed to be “Stellar creating datasets”): **model** selection from **Model Garden** + **hyperparameters** + identifiers for the **register/stored** data and **splits** as required by that API.
- **Status** polling, error handling, idempotency for each integrated endpoint.

### B.6 Phase 5 — Model Garden (UI + BFF aggregation)

- **Model registry connectors** (incremental per Citi: primary internal catalog first, then others; **separate** from Stellar **data** register/store unless contract ties them).
- **List, filter, detail** pages; **lineage** and **"where it lives"**; **select for job**.

### B.7 Phase 6 — Evaluation and observability

- **Evaluation API** after finetune (or on demand).
- **Dashboards:** pipeline health, **split** stats, **register/store** and **finetune**-job duration (per integrated services), **eval** metrics, comparison across runs (same correlation / SOEID filters for audit views).

### B.8 Phase 7 — Hardening

- HITL **quarantine** for bad rows, **SLOs**, **runbook** for failed Stellar or GSSP steps.

## C. Architecture summary

| Area | Reuse | Replace / new |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **React / Vite UI shell, design system** | **High** | Citi theming, new routes (Pipelines, Model Garden, Runs). |
| **Local training / workers / local inference** | **Low** | **Not** on critical path; optional feature-flag off. |
| **Data Recipes UI idea** | **Concept** | New recipe definitions bound to **our** BFF, not local graph executors. |

**Usability:** treat upstream as a **head-start for UX and engineering patterns**, not as the **execution engine** for Citi. **Reusability** is strongest in **frontend**; **weakest** in **GPU training and local model paths**.

---

## D. End-to-end tech stack (suggested)

- **UI:** React, Vite, existing component patterns; add routes for **Model Garden**, **Runs**, **Sources**.
- **BFF:** FastAPI (or Citi-mandated stack) for orchestration, **not** for ML training.
- **Persistence:** PostgreSQL (runs, steps, recipe version, **split** metadata, **Stellar** ids, **model** registry cache pointers).
- **Queue:** async workers for long **Ingestion** / Stellar / GSSP **batch** jobs.
- **Object storage:** S3/Blob; **signed URLs** where applicable.
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry, **correlation id** on all spans.

---

## E. Studio style vs. agent style

- **Primary:** **Studio** — recipes, runs, data sources, **Model Garden**, **register/store** and **finetune**-job status (per Citi service map), **eval** dashboards.
- **Secondary:** **Assisted** flows (wizards, prompt drafts via GSSP) without **opaque** autonomous agents for regulated use.

---

## F. Visualization

- **Run detail:** **step** timeline, **GSSP** call summaries (no raw secrets), **Stellar** register/store status (and other **service** job states as wired), **split** summary (counts per split).
- **Model Garden:** **cards** and **tables**, **lineage** graph (lightweight).
- **Eval:** **metrics** (task-dependent), **trends**, **compare** two finetune runs.
- Reuse standard **card** and **table** layout; add **Citi-appropriate** chart components.

---

## G. Data cleaning and extra processing (optional steps)

- PII / redaction, dedupe, length limits, **multimodal** normalization, **multi-turn** repair, **schema** validation, **quarantine** queue.

---

## H. Glossary (this document)

- **GSSP GS:** LLM API only (OpenAI-style); **not** a full data platform.
- **Stellar:** **Registering and storing** data only; **not** dataset creation, row generation, or splitting. **We** own **dataset creation** and **train/test/val split** in orchestration, then **register/store** in Stellar as required. **Finetune** and **eval** use the **Citi** endpoints defined in the integration contract (not conflated with Stellar’s register/store role unless the same platform exposes multiple roles explicitly).
- **Model Garden:** **UI + BFF** aggregation to **list/select/view** **external** models; **no** weight hosting in-app.

---

## I. Citi-centric Studio backend (no local `core.training` / `core.inference` / `core.export`)

- This repository **removes** the upstream **`core.training`**, **`core.inference`**, and **`core.export`** trees and their subprocess workers. **`routes.training`**, **`routes.models`**, **`routes.inference`**, and **`routes.export`** are the **stub-compatible** implementations (same URL layout; placeholders for **Model Garden / GSSP / Stellar** wiring). Training **history** (`/api/train/runs`, SQLite) is unchanged.
- Responses include **`citi_api_placeholder`** (or the shared **`CITI_EXTERNAL_API_PLACEHOLDER`** string in `utils/local_ml.py`) where clients should call **Citi Model Garden, GSSP/GS, Stellar register/store**, or other approved APIs.
- **GGUF helper precache** and **local LLM-assisted dataset detection** are not used (no local weights); heuristics and external APIs carry those flows.

---

## J. Next steps to maintain this document

- Link **Stellar** and **Ingestion** **API** versions when frozen.
- Add **sequence diagrams** in a `docs/citi/diagrams/` folder if useful.
- Update **Phase** checkboxes in project management tool of record; keep this file as the **narrative** source of truth.
